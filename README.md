We have implemented Hertel-Mehlhorn Convex Partitioning algorithm which uses
the triagulation generated by Ear Clipping method as an input. 

The test inputs and results are stored in the "results" folder.
The input.txt file contains the input polygon coordinates and input.bmp contains the visual representation of the input. Execute run.cpp to generate the output partitioned images. The polygon-partitioning result is stored as polygonization.bmp and the triangulation result is stored as triangulation.bmp. To run the code use the following commands:

```
cd Polygon-Partitioning
g++ run.cpp image.cpp imageio.cpp polypartition.cpp
./a.out
```

Time/Space complexity: `O(n^2)/O(n)`

Supports holes: Yes

Quality of solution: At most four times the minimum number of convex polygons is created. However, in practice it works much better than that and often gives optimal partition.
