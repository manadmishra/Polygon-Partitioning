We have implemented Herkel-Mehlhorn Convex Partitioning algorithm which uses
the triagulation generated by Ear Clipping method as an input. 

The input.txt file contains the input polygon coordinates. Run test.cpp to
generate the output partitioned images.

Time/Space complexity: `O(n^2)/O(n)`

Supports holes: Yes

Quality of solution: At most four times the minimum number of convex polygons is created. However, in practice it works much better than that and often gives optimal partition.
