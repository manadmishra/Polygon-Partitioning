We have implemented Herkel-Mehlhorn Convex Partitioning algorithm which uses
the triagulation generated by Ear Clipping method as an input. 

The input.txt file contains the input polygon coordinates. Run run.cpp to
generate the output partitioned images. Result is stored in polygonization.bmp

```
cd Polygon-Partitioning
g++ run.cpp image.cpp imageio.cpp polypartition.cpp
./a.out
```

Time/Space complexity: `O(n^2)/O(n)`

Supports holes: Yes

Quality of solution: At most four times the minimum number of convex polygons is created. However, in practice it works much better than that and often gives optimal partition.
